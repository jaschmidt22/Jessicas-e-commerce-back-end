# E-commerce Back End

## Description

I was given the task of building the back end for an e-commerce web site. E-commerce (internet retail) plays a significant role in all industries, but especially in electronics. E-commerce platforms provide a variety of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the widespread usage of these platforms, it is important for web developers to understand the architecture of e-commerce sites. During the making of this project, I was required to take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Once it is up and running I will be able to display data from categories, products, and tags in a formatted JSON. The application should also be able to create, update, and delete data in the MySQL database.

## Usage

First, you will need to install Node.js and install the packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database. Be sure to install the dotenv package to store your user name and password. Make sure you log into MySQL, then run the schema.sql file to create the database using MySQL shell commands. Then use the "npm run seed" command to seed the database. Once the database is seeded, run the server and then head on over to Postman or Insomnia to test routes for categories, products, and tags.
